My name is selamawit lemma I was born and raised in Ethiopia and come to USA after I  get my bacheler degree in Managment almost four years ago. In my four years exprianse in USA I had to work in a lot of part time and full time jobs which does't pay much for all the necccety in life it is then I decided in order to live  a decent and unrushed life  I knew I should fnishe my school in any way so unfortunately COVID happen which led all of us to stay at home so in the last almost six month I descided to study little about coding and become intrested in Coding and since the job demand and the pay rate is high Idecided to take thise coding class.
